# Accessibility Application
**Accessibility NYC** (official name is to be finalized) is a web application designed to provide route&destination recommendations for people with disabilities.

## Features

## Workflow
1. Create your own branch from branch 'dev' and start working on it
    - Name the branch after your name and the specific feature you want to develop or bug you want to fix
      - If it focuses on a feature, use descriptive names like: danielle/map-render, danielle/icon-display
      - If it focuses on a bug, use descriptive names starting with fix like: danielle/fix-ok-button, danielle/fix-filter-tab
2. Periodically commit changes and push to remote repo on your own branch
3. Periodically pull changes from remote repo on branch 'dev', and merge 'dev' into your own local branch to keep it up-to-date
4. When the feature/bug fix is ready, make a pull request from your own branch to 'dev'
5. After the pull request is reviewed, revised and approved, merge the pull request to branch 'dev'

Maintenance lead merges branch 'dev' into main branch at the end of each sprint as a version of the app. Otherwise, please do not directly push to or merge into the main branch.
If anything unexpected or undesired happens after you make a commit, push to remote, make a pull request or whatever, don't worry and contact the maintenance lead. We will fix it together!

## Running

## Testing
- Conduct basic unit tests for the feature you develop on your own branch before merge it into 'dev'.
- Maintenance lead conducts unit tests, integration tests and E2E tests on branch 'dev' for all available features.
- Automatic tests like load test, security test and performance test will be conducted after sprint 3 by maintenance lead.
